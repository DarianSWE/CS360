Event Tracker App
Overview
The Event Tracker app was designed to help users, including students, professionals, and anyone looking to stay organized, track and manage their events, tasks, and appointments. It offers an intuitive interface that integrates with the user's phone calendar and sends SMS notifications for reminders, ensuring important tasks or events are never missed.

User Needs Addressed
This app was designed to meet the needs of users who want a simple, effective way to manage their schedules and tasks. The key user needs include:

A way to organize and track events or tasks.

Seamless integration with the user's existing calendar.

SMS notifications for important reminders or events.

Screens & Features
The app includes the following key screens and features:

Event Tracker Screen: Displays upcoming events and tasks, allowing users to add, update, and delete entries.

SMS Permission Screen: Requests SMS permissions and provides status updates on whether the app can send notifications.

Navigation to SMS Activity: A temporary button was added for easy navigation to the SMS notification feature.

The UI was designed with simplicity in mind. The screens are clean and straightforward, with clear buttons and minimal text to avoid overwhelming the user. I took inspiration from other calendar apps to create a familiar, yet functional design. The design's success lies in its intuitive layout, making it easy for users to interact with.

Coding Process
I approached the development process by breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps. This helped me focus on one feature at a time without feeling overwhelmed. I used frequent testing and debugging, checking for bugs early to ensure smooth functionality. I relied on Stack Overflow and other resources when I encountered roadblocks, allowing me to stay productive.

This approach of breaking tasks into smaller pieces and debugging frequently will be useful in future projects as it keeps the workflow organized and prevents errors from escalating.

Testing
I tested the app extensively on the Android Emulator, ensuring that each screen and feature functioned correctly. The permission request for sending SMS notifications was particularly important, and I tested both scenarios: granting and denying permissions. This process revealed that handling permission denial properly is crucial for user experience, ensuring the app still works seamlessly even when features are limited.

Testing is critical to ensuring the app performs as expected under various conditions. It helps identify issues early, improving overall quality and user satisfaction.

Innovation & Overcoming Challenges
One challenge I faced was handling the SMS permission requests and ensuring that the app functioned even when the user denied permission. I had to innovate by making sure that the app still provided value, even without this feature, allowing the user to continue using other functionalities without issues.

Knowledge, Skills & Experience
The most successful part of this project was integrating SMS notifications, as it involved both understanding the technical requirements (SMS permissions, phone calendar access) and user experience considerations (ensuring the app functions well even if permissions are denied). This demonstrated my ability to balance technical implementation with user-centered design.
